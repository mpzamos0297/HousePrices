📌 Overview

This project is part of the Final Project – Machine Learning Course. it is a hands on project that will help us practice our knowledge and gain expertise

**Problem:**
🏠 Predict the final price of homes in Ames & Iowa evaluating the different variables that can affect the price of a home. 

**Goal:**
- Apply concepts learned throughout the course—data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation—to build the best-performing predictive model.
- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
- Complete clear and concise analysist of the results
